# Volume rendering of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

Methods are a much simplified API on top of the python VTK wrapper for isosurface and volume rendering.

Input file, values for volumes, isosurfaces, their color transer functions, and opacities.

Multiple volumes and isosurfaces can be rendered simultaneously using one function.

Each volume and isosurface can have its own color and opacity list, extending to a pseudo multidimensional transfer function.
